## 可迭代的集合 Iterable collections
For many applications, the client's requirement is just to process `each of the items` in some ways,or to `iterate` through the items in 
the collection.

This paradigm is so important that it has achieved first-class status in Java and many other modern languages.( the programming language 
itself has specific meachnisms to support it, not just the library.

## what we need to do to implement in any iterable collection **in Java**
1. The collection must implement an **iterator()** method that returns an **Iterator** object.

2. Thte **Iterator**class must include two methods: **hasnext()**(which returns a **boolean** value) and **next()**(which returns a 
generic item from the collection.
